🎬 **Movie Recommendation System**
📖**About**

This project focuses on analyzing movie ratings data to extract insights that support the development of recommendation systems. By combining user rating behavior with movie metadata, the analysis highlights both critically appreciated movies and those with high audience engagement.

The goal is to demonstrate how data exploration, aggregation, and visualization can be used to understand user preferences and movie popularity.

🧠 **What This Project Does**

Analyzes large-scale user rating data

Identifies top-rated movies based on aggregated ratings

Identifies popular movies based on rating frequency

Visualizes trends to support recommendation insights

🛠 **Tech Stack**

Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical plots

📂 **Datasets**

Movies Dataset: Contains movie titles and genres

Ratings Dataset: Contains user ratings and timestamps

These datasets are merged using a unique movie identifier to enable joint analysis.

🔍**Analysis Approach**

Load and inspect datasets

Clean and validate data

Merge ratings with movie information

Aggregate ratings to measure:

Overall rating score

Popularity by number of ratings

Visualize key findings

📊**Key Insights**

Popular movies are not always the highest-rated

User engagement plays a critical role in recommendation systems

Aggregated rating metrics help surface meaningful trends

🚀**Project Status**

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis completed
🔜 Can be extended to:

Collaborative Filtering

Content-Based Recommendations

Hybrid Recommendation Models

📌 **Why This Project Matters**

This project serves as a strong foundation for understanding how real-world recommendation systems begin — with data. It emphasizes clean analysis, thoughtful aggregation, and clear visualization as essential steps before applying machine learning models.
